# Javascript Dev Starter Kit	

Hi! Here we are introducing a Javascript dev starter kit to setup there system in one go Initially it will be only for Mac but later we will move it to some playbook so it can work in any environment.


# Future Enhancement 

1. Give an option to select the installations are available as part of our script so the user can also skip the installation which they don't want.
2. One they select nvm it also ask for version.
3. User coloured messaging.

```
git clone https://github.com/Krishank/javascript-dev-starterkit.git
cd javascript-dev-starterkit
chmox 777 setup.sh
